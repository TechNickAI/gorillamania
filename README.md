# Nick.README

Version [1.3.1](https://semver.org/)

[TL;DR](https://www.howtogeek.com/435266/what-does-tldr-mean-and-how-do-you-use-it/) - I‚Äôm the Founder and CEO of HeartRithm, which is my life‚Äôs work. I aim to lead with my heart, set a great example, and serve **you** on this epic journey we are on together.

## Nick Sullivan, the human being

The best way to motivate me that is ethical is to give me a challenging problem that technology can solve.

Creation brings me joy - taking an idea and making it real, seeing something come to life.

Manifestation is my superpower, which I define as visualizing a future state with high levels of experiential energy, allowing for serendipity and aligned forces to create the outcome. I‚Äôm also great at getting a lot of things done daily, effectively solving the company's most challenging problems for breakfast.

My best character attribute is my continual quest for self-improvement. I value truth over ego and crave feedback for anyways I can improve.

My [love language is Acts of Service](https://www.5lovelanguages.com/2009/02/acts-of-service/); please tell me something I can do for you. I‚Äôm fueled by gratitude. üôè

### Significant parts of my story that have shaped who I am

On a somber note, my father died when I was 10 years old. I share that not because it defines who I am today, nor do I seek pity.¬† It is an essential part of my story growing up - I was effectively the ‚Äúman of the house‚Äù at 10, which accelerated my growth. I also had my risk tolerance set high very early on, because I‚Äôd already survived something so difficult - the rest of my life‚Äôs challenges seemed trivial by comparison. It‚Äôs been an essential part of my path.

I had 4 children by the time I was 23. I skipped college and started providing for my family. I‚Äôm a self-taught software engineer. Without a formal education, I took advantage of the meritocratic nature of technology to rise to the top quickly.

I've held many successful technology leadership positions. I‚Äôm usually the first technologist at a company that builds the initial version of the product and then hires & scales the team. In addition, I‚Äôve actively participated in the technology ecosystem across many roles: founder, technology leader, meetup/community organizer, startup mentor, advisor, and investor. I did Silicon Valley very well, working 80 hours a week for 18 years, under the promise of not having to work 40.

My technology career has generated millions of dollars in value,¬† with a [nice exit](https://www.saastr.com/inside-story-krux-700m-acquisition-video-transcript/) along the way.¬† There have been many industries - digital media, consumer web, ad-tech, fin-tech, and crypto - with a consistent theme of teaching computers to understand people.

In 2013, I read the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/). All lightbulbs went off; Bitcoin would be a revolutionary technology. It would enable *Trust through validation* vs. Trust through *reputation*. So I threw my career behind Bitcoin in 2013, creating ChangeTIp, a bitcoin tipping engine for Social Media ([acquired by Airbnb](https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-buys-bitcoin-startup-changecoin-2016-4)). ChangeTip was a gratitude and appreciation engine for the web, or as I like to call it - a Love Button for the Internet.

I‚Äôm known as a top CEO in crypto, and I‚Äôve been called a ‚Äú[Top 25 Mind in Bitcoin](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MBB-37444)‚Äù - that was easier to do in 2015!

My partner is Brigitte, who I call my Goddess of Love and Light. She opened my heart and inspired many of the ideas for HeartRithm‚Äôs genesis. She‚Äôs now the Chief Love Officer at HeartRithm, and our engagement story is a pretty good one. Ask me about it sometime.

### My Purpose

Whether you call it Purpose, Mission, Dharma, or [Perfectenshlag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3kl1SPCNtg), I am so deep in it here at HeartRithm.

Even the company name, HeartRithm (Heart + [algo]Rithm, speaks to what I consider my ultimate dharma to help build the healthy intersection of humanity and technology. It‚Äôs time to stop living out the cold dark dystopian future that plays out in our media and establish that technology is here to be a force for good. Technology in and of itself is amoral; it just imbues the values of its creators. I‚Äôve spent 20+ years building up my career, connections, reputation, and skills to make HeartRithm possible, and I wake up [almost] every day grateful for the opportunity to create a massive positive impact in the world using my gifts.

### My Core Values

Here‚Äôs a visual representation. The first ring represents the high-level core values, and the outer ring is made up of examples.

Note: My process for generating the above graphic was to start with a [list of values](https://scottjeffrey.com/core-values-list/), select the ones that applied to me, and then thoughtfully group them with [Xmind](https://www.xmind.net/). If you‚Äôre inspired to do the same, I‚Äôd love to see yours!

## My role at HeartRithm

### What kind of CEO am I?

I don‚Äôt usually like being bucketed, but according to this article describing the [6 types of CEOs](https://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/content/features/the-six-types-of-ceo), I‚Äôm a Global Missionary.

I see my primary responsibilities as:

1. Holding the vision of what‚Äôs to be built with this multi-generational company
2. Align incentives and pull energy to the cause
3. Solve the most challenging problems to free up momentum

My secondary responsibilities include

- Leading by example - to be emblematic of our cultural values
- Attracting, hiring, engaging, and developing world-class talent
- Fundraising to make sure we have sufficient fuel

I‚Äôm a technologist at my core, and I‚Äôll assume whatever role is necessary to make HeartRithm successful.

### Objectives to accomplish on the HeartRithm journey

It‚Äôs not enough to achieve the mission of becoming a regenerative engine for social impact; we also have to be proud of how we do it along the way. These objectives are important to me:

- The New Story of Money. HeartRithm is an emblematic example of a business model that scraps the traditional mantra of ‚Äúmaximizing shareholder value‚Äù, and instead shows that leading the business with a social impact mission is great for business.
- Restoring the balance of the masculine and feminine energy
- Showcasing the power of regenerative systems that create Upward Spirals, the more energy you put in, the more you get out. Note this is why the original tag line for HeartRithm was ‚ÄúA Regenerative Engine for Social Impact‚Äù
- Showing that Unconditional Love belongs in business, and that choosing love (using your heart) should be the highest order decision making bit
- Employing 21st Century Organizational principles, as defined in [Reinventing Organizations](https://www.reinventingorganizations.com/) - the top-down hierarchical model in corporate America will give way to a decentralized, empowered, self-driven company.

## Working with me

Some other tips that I‚Äôve learned for effectively running companies

- I love [Conscious Leadership](https://www.amazon.com/15-Commitments-Conscious-Leadership-Sustainable-ebook/dp/B00R3MHWUE) - it‚Äôs a fantastic framework for us to align on values and behaviors to run the company well
- Please beg for forgiveness rather than ask for permission, and know that you are responsible for the impact of your decisions, so I trust that you‚Äôll ask for guidance when it benefits.
- Critique is cheap; craftsmanship is priceless.
- When others see friction in markets, I see opportunity!
- Bias towards action. Find the ‚ÄúNo Regrets‚Äù moves to make progress in uncertain environments
- Failure is celebrated - as long as we learn from it.

If I‚Äôm stressed, it‚Äôs usually because I have too much to do. You can help out by taking something off my plate, or by helping me organize myself.

### Tactical

I‚Äôm available on almost all of the messaging platforms (Signal, WhatsApp, iMessage @ +1(925)353-7603); my username just about everywhere is gorillamania. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs a username that I created in 1996, and I‚Äôm kinda stuck with it now.

I prefer to use the lowest urgency communication method that accomplishes the goal and ask that you do the same.

Slack communication should be the default for work. If I text you for a personal matter, it will usually be via SMS/iMessage. Note: I often send messages at odd hours or on the weekends - that does not mean I expect you to respond immediately. You respond when it‚Äôs the right time for you. I‚Äôll call you if I need you.

Do you need time with me? My schedule is often very full, and my calendar is meticulously managed by my personal assistant [Asa](mailto:asa@heartrithm.com). You can either reach out to her or book a time on my [calendly link](https://calendly.com/nicksullivan/30min).

### I work best with people who

1. Maintain a healthy field of trust with me. My framework of trust includes 4 pillars.
    1. **Integrity**: Living by your own values
    2. **Reliability**: Consistently deliver on commitments. Note: This doesn‚Äôt mean consistently hitting deadlines. I *love it* when people reset expectations when circumstances change.
    3. **Fidelity:** Making choices that consider the impact on others, not just yourself
    4. **Competence**: produce high-quality work, and be self-aware enough to ask for help when you are over your head.
2. Demonstrate that they are aligned with me and the company‚Äôs goals
3. Are a joy to work with!

### Giving me feedback

I crave feedback, as it is one of our best tools for self-development. I embrace vulnerability because that‚Äôs where connection and trust are built. I consider myself excellent at receiving feedback, but I want to hear from you if you feel otherwise. üòâ
